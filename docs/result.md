## Fig 1. 
Strain test on knot to give stress-strain curve. 

## Fig 2. 
Cycling strain test and the structure and energy analysis before and after reversible drop - phase transition.

## Fig 3. 
Atomic temperature and Heat flux  of loose and tight knot and same-length graphene in NEMD simulation.



## Fig 4. 
Participation ratio and power spectra of structures in Fig 3. 

## Fig 5. 
Transmission spectra of the structures, the tranmission of knot is expected to be much small. Real space transmit path.

## Fig 6.
Melting curve which can be used to classify glass and crystal.  This is to clearify the knot is like bulk graphene or amorphous.
