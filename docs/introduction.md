# Introduction

## Crystal-amorphous transition
## Knot exists every where and it’s a connection between 1D and 0D materials
## Graphene is suitable for the exploring of CAT base on knot
## From first principle and classical MD we explore thermal and electronic properties of graphene knot and found it’s a controllable CAT material under uniaxial  stress.
