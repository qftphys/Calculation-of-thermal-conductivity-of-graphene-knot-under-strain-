The knot's ends are found to jump to well defined sequential locations that are associated with sharp turns, whereas in homopolymers they diffuse around and eventually slide off. The waiting times of the jumps are increasingly stochastic as the temperature is raised. Knots typically do not return to their native locations when a protein is released after stretching.},

abstract = {Long DNA molecules can self-entangle into knots. Experimental techniques for observing such DNA knots (primarily gel electrophoresis) are limited to bulk methods and circular molecules below 10 kilobase pairs in length. Here, we show that solid-state nanopores can be used to directly observe individual knots in both linear and circular single DNA molecules of arbitrary length. The DNA knots are observed as short spikes in the nanopore current traces of the traversing DNA molecules and their detection is dependent on a sufficiently high measurement resolution, which can be achieved using high-concentration LiCl buffers. We study the percentage of molecules with knots for DNA molecules of up to 166 kilobase pairs in length and find that the knotting occurrence rises with the length of the DNA molecule, consistent with a constant knotting probability per unit length. Our experimental data compare favourably with previous simulation-based predictions for long polymers. From the translocation time of the knot through the nanopore, we estimate that the majority of the DNA knots are tight, with remarkably small sizes below 100 nm. In the case of linear molecules, we also observe that knots are able to slide out on application of high driving forces (voltage).},

abstract = {Knots are fascinating non-trivial topological entities.They are not only present in art and history but in many scientific fields as well, from mathematics to biology. By tar- geting this tantalizing structure,chemists have contributed to the promotion of their beauty. So far, two very different template syntheses of molecular knots have been developed. The first one is based on the template effect induced by a transition metal, which gathers and disposes fragments in a predictable geometry. The second relies on the use of a suitable hydrogen bond-set. Together with the presentation of these two reliable strategies, this chapter stresses one of the intrinsic properties of a knot: its chirality.The resolution of the two kinds of molecular knots into their enantiomers is discussed.},

abstract = {Cyclin‐dependent kinase 5 (cdk5) is a serine/threonine kinase activated by associating with its neuron‐specific activators p35 and p39. Analysis of cdk5−/− and p35−/− mice has demonstrated that both cdk5 and p35 are essential for neuronal migration, axon pathfinding and the laminar configuration of the cerebral cortex, suggesting that the cdk5–p35 complex may play a role in neuron survival. However, the targets of cdk5 that regulate neuron survival are unknown. Here, we show that cdk5 directly phosphorylates c‐Jun N‐terminal kinase 3 (JNK3) on Thr131 and inhibits its kinase activity, leading to reduced c‐Jun phosphorylation. Expression of cdk5 and p35 in HEK293T cells inhibits c‐Jun phosphorylation induced by UV irradiation. These effects can be restored by expression of a catalytically inactive mutant form of cdk5. Moreover, cdk5‐deficient cultured cortical neurons exhibit increased sensitivity to apoptotic stimuli, as well as elevated JNK3 activity and c‐Jun phosphorylation. Taken together, these findings show that cdk5 may exert its role as a key element by negatively regulating the c‐Jun N‐terminal kinase/stress‐activated protein kinase signaling pathway during neuronal apoptosis.},

abstract = {Many experiments have been done to determine the relative strengths of different knots, and these show that the break in a knotted rope almost invariably occurs at the point just outside the 'entrance' to the knot. The influence of knots on the properties of polymers has become of great interest, in part because of their effect on mechanical properties. Knot theory applied to the topology of macromolecules indicates that the simple trefoil or 'overhand' knot is likely to be present in any long polymer strand. Fragments of DNA have been observed to contain such knots in experiments and computer simulations. Here we use ab initio computational methods to investigate the effect of a trefoil knot on the breaking strength of a polymer strand. We find that the knot weakens the strand significantly, and that, like a knotted rope, it breaks under tension at the entrance to the knot.},

abstract = {How and why do molecules tangle or thread? Investigations of molecular knots (knotanes) may shed some light on the mechanisms of (supra)molecular templation and the folding of molecules that result in intertwining. The topological chirality of these fascinating molecules leads to new types of isomerism and paves the way to nanosized molecular motors. Their preparation and derivatization makes high demands on modern synthetic methods and analytical separation since molecular knots are formed in a more or less planned design based on metal coordination or hydrogen-bonding patterns. This Review describes the development of templation techniques for the synthesis of knotanes and their chiral resolution as well as their selective functionalization and use as building blocks in the synthesis of higher knotane assemblies. Such assemblies can possess linear, branched, or even macrocyclic structures which, on the one hand, introduce unprecedented isomeric compositions that arise from multiple topological stereogenic units and, on the other, define new types of artificial macromolecules beyond polymers and dendritic species.},

abstract = {Filamentous structures are abundant in cells. Relatively rigid filaments, such as microtubules and actin, serve as intracellular scaffolds that support movement and force, and their mechanical properties are crucial to their function in the cell. Some aspects of the behaviour of DNA, meanwhile, depend critically on its flexibility-for example, DNA-binding proteins can induce sharp bends in the helix. The mechanical characterization of such filaments has generally been conducted without controlling the filament shape, by the observation of thermal motions or of the response to external forces or flows. Controlled buckling of a microtubule has been reported, but the analysis of the buckled shape was complicated. Here we report the continuous control of the radius of curvature of a molecular strand by tying a knot in it, using optical tweezers to manipulate the strand's ends. We find that actin filaments break at the knot when the knot diameter falls below 0.4 microm. The pulling force at breakage is around 1 pN, two orders of magnitude smaller than the tensile stress of a straight filament. The flexural rigidity of the filament remained unchanged down to this diameter. We have also knotted a single DNA molecule, opening up the possibility of studying curvature-dependent interactions with associated proteins. We find that the knotted DNA is stronger than actin.},

In fluids, the fundamental knottedness-carrying excitations occur in the form of linked and knotted vortex loops, which have been conjectured to exist for over a century. Although they have been the subject of considerable theoretical study, their creation in the laboratory has remained an outstanding experimental goal. Here we report the creation of isolated trefoil vortex knots and pairs of linked vortex rings in water using a new method of accelerating specially shaped hydrofoils. Using a high-speed scanning tomography apparatus, we measure their three-dimensional topological and geometrical evolution in detail. In both cases we observe that the linked vortices stretch themselves and then deform—as dictated by their geometrically determined energy—towards a series of local vortex reconnections. This work establishes the existence and dynamics of knotted vortices in real fluids.},

abstract = {Knots are being discovered with increasing frequency in both biological and synthetic macromolecules and have been fundamental topological targets for chemical synthesis for the past two decades. Here, we report on the synthesis of the most complex non-DNA molecular knot prepared to date: the self-assembly of five bis-aldehyde and five bis-amine building blocks about five metal cations and one chloride anion to form a 160-atom-loop molecular pentafoil knot (five crossing points). The structure and topology of the knot is established by NMR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry and X-ray crystallography, revealing a symmetrical closed-loop double helicate with the chloride anion held at the centre of the pentafoil knot by ten CH{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}{\textperiodcentered}Cl(-) hydrogen bonds. The one-pot self-assembly reaction features an exceptional number of different design elements-some well precedented and others less well known within the context of directing the formation of (supra)molecular species. We anticipate that the strategies and tactics used here can be applied to the rational synthesis of other higher-order interlocked molecular architectures.},

Its dependence on the chemical potential and the number of atoms in the chain is qualitatively different from that in the case of normal metal leads. Electron transport proceeds via narrow resonant states in the wire. The latter arise due to strong reflection at the junctions between the chain and the leads, which is caused by the small density of states in the leads at low energy. The energy dependence of the transmission coefficient near resonance is asymmetric and acquires a universal form at small energies. We find that in the case of leads with the zigzag edges the dispersion of the edge states has a significant effect on the device conductance.},
